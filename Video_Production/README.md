### Video Production Scheduler

Made with ASP.Net Core MVC, this application allows the user to Create an Account or Log In using
a variety of methods such as e-mail, Google, Facebook, etc.

By clicking on CLIENT in the Navbar, the user can then CREATE a NEW CLIENT by inputing the FIRST 
and LAST NAME.

The user then clicks on CREW and can CREATE a CREW NAME and enter any CREW MEMBERS' NAMES that 
they have.

The user can then click on PRODUCTIONS in the Navbar and CREATE a NEW PRODUCTION. There is a
drop-down list for the CLIENT NAME and CREW if this info has already been entered. The user can
then fill in the rest of the info to complete the form.

Each form has appropiate EDIT and DELETE options.
